These Bash scripts are intended to run in a Linux environment.

COMMANDS:
    ./init1.sh
    ./random_word.sh
    ./apply_example.sh < ./some_nums.txt

init1.sh and init2.sh demonstrates very basic usage of variables

random_word.sh demonstrates reading from a file, arrays, and random numbers

apply_example.sh demonstates function usage and some other stuff, it is probably the more
interesting script to examine.
